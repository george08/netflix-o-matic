	<h1 style="font-size: 2em;">Humans are watching more <a href="http://netflix.com">Netflix</a> than ever. We'd like to help.</h1>
	<p>At <a href="http://goodformandspectacle.com">Good, Form & Spectacle</a> we're interested in what happens when you take away search boxes on websites. Turns out it can be pretty fun, especially when you have well-constructed classifications that lead you to movies you didn't know you wanted to watch.</p>
	<p>Here's the story of our Netflix Scrambler...</p>
	
	<h2>December 2, 2013</h2>
	<p><a href="http://www.alexismadrigal.com/">Alexis Madrigal</a> tweets his curiosity about Netflix "microgenres".</p>

	<h2>December 5, 2013</h2>
	<p>Noodling around one evening, I discover a magic URL thanks to Mr. Madrigal's sleuthing. If you're a member on Netflix, you can bounce around genres just by changing the number part of the URL...</p>
	<p><a href="https://twitter.com/george08/status/408813451847299073" title="but, this is my private account"><img width="400" src="glo-tweet.gif" /></a></p>
	<p>Within moments, Paul Mison and Nick Sweeney join in and start to try to gather genres. </p>

	<h2>January 2, 2014</h2>
	<p>Madrigal publishes in The Atlantic. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/"><em>How Netflix Reverse Engineered Hollywood</em></a> included a "Netflix genre generator" and lots of interesting stuff about how he pulled everything apart.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>"We've now spent several weeks understanding, analyzing, and reverse-engineering how Netflix's vocabulary and grammar work. We've broken down its most popular descriptions, and counted its most popular actors and directors. </p>
		<p>"To my (and Netflix's) knowledge, no one outside the company has ever assembled this data before.</p>
		<p>"What emerged from the work is this conclusion: Netflix has meticulously analyzed and tagged every movie and TV show imaginable. They possess a stockpile of data about Hollywood entertainment that is absolutely unprecedented. The genres that I scraped and that we caricature above are just the surface manifestation of this deeper database."</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>So, before we knew it, Madrigal's research had become a full-blown article. Darn! I was left feeling that this "caricature" in the article was just that, and not actually useful at all to people looking for something to watch. <em>Could we make something useful?</em> My interest is not dismemberment, but revelation and fun.</p>	
	<p>Since the article came out, we've each looked at this when we've had time. There's a server and search, a lot of poking at big spreadsheets, and getting together when we could. Designs started popping out mid-September, and here we are.</p>
	
	<p>We hope you enjoy it! <a href="sketch-1.html">Scramble</a>?</p>
