	<h1 style="font-size: 2em;">Humans are watching more <a href="http://netflix.com">Netflix</a> than ever. <br />We've built an enabler.</h1>
	<p>At <a href="http://goodformandspectacle.com">Good, Form & Spectacle</a> we're interested in what happens when you take away search boxes on websites. Turns out it can be pretty fun, especially when you have well-constructed classifications that lead you to movies you didn't know you wanted to watch.</p>
	<p>Here's the story of our Netflix Genre Explorer...</p>

	<h2>December 5, 2013</h2>
	<p>Tooling around one evening, I uncover a magic URL, via Mr. Madrigal's sleuthing, with which you can -- if you're a member of Netflix -- bounce around genres semi-randomly just by changing the number part of the URL...</p>

	<p>Within moments, Paul Mison and Nick Sweeney to pile on, immediately "considering a dictionary <s>attack</s>" browse.</p>

	<h2>January 2, 2014</h2>
	<p>Madrigal's work ends up in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/"><em>How Netflix Reverse Engineered Hollywood</em></a> that included a "Netflix genre generator," and lots of interesting stuff about how he pulled everything apart.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>"We've now spent several weeks understanding, analyzing, and reverse-engineering how Netflix's vocabulary and grammar work. We've broken down its most popular descriptions, and counted its most popular actors and directors. </p>
		<p>"To my (and Netflix's) knowledge, no one outside the company has ever assembled this data before.</p>
		<p>"What emerged from the work is this conclusion: Netflix has meticulously analyzed and tagged every movie and TV show imaginable. They possess a stockpile of data about Hollywood entertainment that is absolutely unprecedented. The genres that I scraped and that we caricature above are just the surface manifestation of this deeper database."</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>So, Paul, Nick and I had been pipped at the post. (We'd though we could maybe build something quick at the time.) I was left feeling that this "caricature" was ultimately just that, and not particularly useful at all in helping people find movies. <em>Could we make something more useful to people wanting something new to watch?</em> My interest is not dismemberment, but revelation and fun.</p>	
	<p>From then until now, Paul, Nick and I have thought about this when we've had time, set up servers, poking at big spreadsheets, and getting together when we could. Designs started popping out mid-September, and here we are.</p>
